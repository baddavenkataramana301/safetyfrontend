# TODO: UI Overhaul for ChecklistBuilder.jsx

## Steps:

- [ ] Refactor layout with flexbox/grid for better responsiveness and spacing
- [ ] Update styling and theming using Tailwind CSS to unify colors, fonts, paddings
- [ ] Replace text buttons (+, -, delete) with icon buttons, add tooltips for clarity
- [ ] Add collapsible sections for better UI organization
- [ ] Improve inline editing with validation feedback when updating cells and titles
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop support for reordering sections and rows
- [ ] Enhance download and submit buttons with more intuitive icons and spacing
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness, usability and functionality after changes

## Notes:
- Consider using existing UI libraries for icons (e.g., lucide-react or similar)
- May need to add or update imports in ChecklistBuilder.jsx
- Follow existing styling conventions (Tailwind CSS) used in project
